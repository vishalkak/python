Subject: Regarding Parking Fine

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I encountered with a recent parking ticket. On [Date x], I parked my vehicle at the Twyford location and paid the parking fee via my bank account. Attached is a copy of the bank record clearly showing the payment made for the parking duration.

Despite making the payment, I have received a parking fine notice from your company, which indicates that the payment was not received. I kindly request that you review your records and verify the payment to rectify this issue promptly.

Please find enclosed a copy of the bank record, indicating the successful payment transaction for your reference and necessary action. I trust that you will promptly resolve this matter and ensure that no further action is taken against me in relation to this incident.

I look forward to your swift resolution and a confirmation of the same. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further information or clarification.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
